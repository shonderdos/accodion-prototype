## Technique

### WAI-ARIA 1.1
WAI-ARIA, the Accessible Rich Internet Applications Suite, defines a way to make Web content and Web applications more
accessible to people with disabilities. It especially helps with dynamic content and advanced user interface controls
developed with Ajax, HTML, JavaScript, and related technologies.

### Custom Elements
Custom Elements is a capability for creating your own custom HTML elements. They can have their own scripted behavior
and CSS styling. They are a part of web components, but can also be used by themselves.

### Progressive enhancement
Progressive enhancement is a strategy for web design that emphasizes core webpage content first. This strategy then
progressively adds more nuanced and technically rigorous layers of presentation and features on top of the content as
the end-user's browser/internet connection allow. The proposed benefits of this strategy are that it allows everyone to
access the basic content and functionality of a web page, using any browser or Internet connection, while also providing
an enhanced version of the page to those with more advanced browser software or greater bandwidth.

This code was build based on a Live Code Session from Google Chrome Developers.
